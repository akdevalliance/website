# Alaska Developers Alliance Operating Manual

This document serves as a repository for running the Alaska Developers Alliance. It describes the organizational structure, functional requirements for the board, budget, group promotion, running and hosting events and the necessary institutional knowledge that the group acquires.

## Promotion

### Sending out a monthly newsletter

    Purpose: Show developers that there is an active programming community with events happening. Spread awareness about events for developers to participate in. Get attendance for events. Promote other groups working in tech that would like to build a following. Even if there are no events, send a newsletter letting people know that there are no events and we will be taking a break until the next event.

#### When: At the beginning of the month.

    1. Gather events, date, time, description, location from:
         1. \#allianceorganizers (slack)
         2. Code for Anchorage - Brendan Babb (brendanbabb@gmail.com)

VMUG - Jeremy Mayfield (slack)
UAA CS club - Link Larson (slack)
UAF CS Club - Matt Perry (slack)

UA student recruitment

Events
Streaming

Start the broadcast when the speaker is ready and verify broadcast is running

Sponsorships

Hackathon Template Email
Hi <their-name>,
My name is <your-name> and I am inquiring about <their-org> sponsoring the Alaska Hackathon on Oct 11th.
The AK Dev Alliance (https://akdevalliance.com/) is a programmer-led volunteer organization that is committed to creating a tech industry within Alaska. We offer training to new and experienced programmers in an effort to increase the programming knowledge of any interested Alaskans. Earlier this month we brought up an expert in a new exciting language, Go, and offered a free weekend class. Now we are putting on a statewide hackathon in Fairbanks, Anchorage, and Juneau on Oct 11th.
Attached is a file that provides more info on the hackathon and our organization. Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions at this email or <your-number>.

Email Template (night before event)
Hello future and current Gophers!

We're stoked for the first part of our 4 day Golang bootcamp tomorrow. For those of you who are based in Anchorage we'll see you at 9am at in Grant Hall room #231 at APU. For those of you who are out of town, but will be attending Ultimate Go next weekend, the zoom link is below.

The 3 day Ultimate Go course 9/13, 9/14, 9/15 will only be available on site.
This is a hands on workshop, please bring your charged laptop and charger with the Go environment installed. We will cover setting up your environment, however, internet on site is questionable and will be conserved for the Zoom conference. If you don't have a chance to install, please download the binary and bring it with you.

https://golang.org/dl/

Curriculum here:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YRqcvr66nxxaOLQeMi__zi5FDeVY7qhHdrQvA3nkDV8/edit?usp=sharing

The goal for tomorrow is to introduce you to the syntax and some basic principles of Go so you can get the most out of Bill Kennedy's course. Don't stress if you get hung up on a concept.

Class starts at 9am. We will have coffee on-site.
Break at 11am
Lunch at 1pm

Lastly, food and beverage can be difficult for us to get funding for. There's a donate button at https://akdevalliance.com if you feel inclined to chip in for coffee.
