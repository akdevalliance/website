  Conroy works with people to build startups around ideas they are passionate about, and that solve a real market need. That's why he started Tandem Labs -- a Startup Studio geared towards validating and building B2B SaaS companies in tandem with industry experts. He partners with Ideators who have the experience and the vision to see and to seize opportunities for improved software serving their industry. Following Lean Startup methodologies, he ensures that they are building something that customers will be willing to pay for to solve a real problem.

  He also runs Juneau Coworking, a shared Office & Event Space for entrepreneurs, work-from-homers, freelancers, side-hustlers, small business owners, nonprofits, and grassroots organizations in Juneau, Alaska.
